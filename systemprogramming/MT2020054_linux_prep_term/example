Microsoft has invested in the security of open-source software for many years and
today Iâ€™m excited to share that Microsoft is joining industry partners to create
the Open Source Security Foundation
(OpenSSF), a new cross-industry collaboration hosted at the Linux Foundation.
The OpenSSF brings together work from
the Linux Foundation-initiated Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII),
the GitHub-initiated Open Source Security Coalition
(OSSC), and other open-source security efforts to improve the security of
open-source software by building a broader
community, targeted initiatives, and best practices. Microsoft is proud
to be a founding member alongside GitHub, Google,
IBM, JPMC, NCC Group, OWASP Foundation, and Red Hat.
